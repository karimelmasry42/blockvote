## 📘 Project Overview  

**BlockVote** is a hybrid **web and mobile platform** designed to provide **secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant digital voting**.  
The system leverages **blockchain** for immutable record-keeping, **cryptography** for voter anonymity and authentication,  
and **artificial intelligence (AI)** for detecting fraudulent or abnormal voting behavior.  

Developed as part of the **AASTMT College of Computing and Information Technology – Cybersecurity Graduation Project (2025–2026)**,  
BlockVote demonstrates how decentralized technologies can ensure **trust**, **integrity**, and **verifiability** in modern digital elections.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Guarantee **data integrity** and prevent vote tampering through blockchain immutability.  
- Provide **secure digital identity management** using cryptographic verification.  
- Deliver a **hybrid architecture** accessible via web and mobile clients.  
- Integrate **AI-based fraud detection** to monitor anomalies and suspicious voting patterns.  

---

## 🧠 Key Features  

✅ Blockchain-based decentralized voting ledger  
✅ Secure voter identity verification with cryptographic keys  
✅ Web (React) and Mobile (Flutter) hybrid system  
✅ Backend APIs secured with JWT and encryption  
✅ AI fraud detection using machine learning models  
✅ Tamper-proof and transparent result auditing  
✅ Admin dashboard for real-time monitoring
